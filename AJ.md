### Inital Thoughts

Duolingo in itself is fantastic. But I have always thought of bringing the experience of duolingo to my notes for the sake of having fun with what I am learning and to make myself more consistent.

I personally use Obsidian for note taking, and essentially that means these notes live within my file system. So what I was thinking is making some sort of framework or tool using CLI AI tools such as Claude Code to read in a folder of notes and from there generate a full set of quizzes.

The behaviors would mirror that of Duolingo. You would have a streak being kept alongside daily quizzes.

I know Duolingo is an app that teaches a course from zero to hero. But the intended vision for my use case is to take your existing notes and create the following:
1. Questions centered on existing notes that serve the purposes of active recall. For example for my datacenters class I just learned about hardware components such as HDD, SSDs, and how memory is layed out within datacenters. From here a set of questions that assist with active recall would be awesome within my tool.
2. Questions that may covered related concepts. For example I have a file that notes down important algorithms such as BFS or DFS. When it comes to a possible set of questions I can be given a buggy BFS implementation that may need fixing.

I want to make this tool sharable for other people to use. I have envisioned making this a possible extension for Obsidian users but Idk.
